== Description ==

There are a lot of comment system plugins for WordPress out there and even some of the more popular ones, such as DISQUS or Facebook intergration plugins, can randomly throw off your comment count in the database. Honestly, with WordPress sometimes the comment count just gets messed up. If a viewer on your website's internet were to go out in the middle of posting a comment there is a chance that it would post the comment but not get to the point to add the comment to the comment count.

The Web Ninja Comment Count Fixer Plugin is here to fix this. Either by the click of a button or set up on a timer it will check the number of comments in the database and compare them to the comment count field in the post table and fix the count if any of them are wrong.

This plugin can be easily configured to be set up on a timer of 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, or 24 hours so you don't have to worry about your comment counts ever getting messed up again. Even if you don't have a problem with your comment counts now you can still install this and never even have to worry about it when it does.
